## NodeJS Test - Team Points Project

The purpose of this project is to give you an opportunity to showcase your
coding style with node.

This is not meant to take longer than the typical 30 min code interview.

You can use any tools (IDE, npm, ...) and resources (google, stackoverflow,...) you use in your day to day.   
However, _you_ should come up with the implementation on your own and not use any external javascript libraries (other than the ones already included in this project)

## Overview

Every night we receive list of players with their: name, team, status, and points for the day.  
We need a function that aggregates points by team, and sorts teams in descending order by total points.  
Only active players should be considered for team points calculation.

## Requirements

* Code must be written using `standardjs` convention

* Code should run in `Node 8.10`

## Submitting the project
 * Clone this repo
 * Implement a working solution for `calculateTeamPoints`
 * Create a new branch and submit a commit with an update to the following files with the working solution
    * `calculateTeamPoints.js`
    * `calculateTeamPoints.test.js`
